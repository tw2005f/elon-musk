            hi!
        </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>
            Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Elon displayed early aptitude for computers. He co-founded Zip2 and X.com
            (later PayPal).
            With the proceeds, he founded SpaceX and became an early investor in Tesla, Inc.
            His vision extends to ventures like Neuralink, The Boring Company, and OpenAI. As SpaceXâ€™s CEO,
            he aims to make humanity multi-planetary. At Tesla, he revolutionized electric vehicles and sustainable
            energy.
            His net worth places him among the worldâ€™s wealthiest. Despite personal challenges, Elon Musk continues to
            innovate and inspire .
            Early Entrepreneurship:
            1. Before co-founding Zip2, Elon and his brother Kimbal lived in a tiny apartment in Silicon Valley,
            surviving on a diet of hot dogs and oranges while working on their startup.
            Zip2 provided online city guides for newspapers, and Elonâ€™s vision was ahead of its time. The companyâ€™s
            acquisition by Compaq for $307 million in 1999 was a pivotal moment in his career.
            PayPal and Financial Success:
            After Zip2, Elon founded X.com, an online payment company. It later merged with Confinity to become PayPal.
            PayPalâ€™s acquisition by eBay for $1.5 billion catapulted Elon into the ranks of Silicon Valleyâ€™s elite.
            His financial success allowed him to pursue even grander ventures.
            SpaceX and the Quest for Mars:
            In 2002, Elon founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX). His goal? To make humanity a
            multi-planetary species.
            SpaceX achieved numerous milestones, including the first privately-funded spacecraft to reach orbit and the
            first privately-funded spacecraft to dock with the International Space Station.
            The Falcon 1, Falcon 9, and Falcon Heavy rockets, along with the Dragon spacecraft, are testaments to his
            vision.
